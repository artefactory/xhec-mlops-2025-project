## üéØ Project Overview

Welcome to your MLOps project! In this hands-on project, you'll build a complete machine learning system to predict the age of abalone (a type of sea snail) using physical measurements instead of the traditional time-consuming method of counting shell rings under a microscope.

**Your Mission**: Transform a simple ML model into a production-ready system with automated training, deployment, and prediction capabilities.

## üìä About the Dataset

Traditionally, determining an abalone's age requires:
1. Cutting the shell through the cone
2. Staining it
3. Counting rings under a microscope (very time-consuming!)

**Your Goal**: Use easier-to-obtain physical measurements (shell weight, diameter, etc.) to predict the age automatically.

üì• **Download**: Get the dataset from the [Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rodolfomendes/abalone-dataset)


## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- [Kaggle account](https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?phase=startRegisterTab&returnUrl=%2F) (for dataset download)
- Python 3.10 or 3.11

### Setup Steps

1. **Fork this repository**
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Uncheck "Copy the `main` branch only" to get all project branches

2. **Add your team members** as admins to your forked repository

3. **Set up your development environment**:
   ```bash
   # Install UV (if not already installed)
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

   # Clone your forked repository
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/xhec-mlops-2025-project.git
   cd xhec-mlops-2025-project

   # Install all dependencies (including dev dependencies)
   uv sync --extra dev

   # Install pre-commit hooks for code quality
   uv run pre-commit install

   # Verify everything is working
   uv run pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

## üìã What You'll Build

By the end of this project, you'll have created:

### ü§ñ **Automated ML Pipeline**
- Training workflows using Prefect
- Automatic model retraining on schedule
- Reproducible model and data processing

### üåê **Prediction API**
- REST API for real-time predictions
- Input validation with Pydantic
- Docker containerization

### üìä **Production-Ready Code**

- Automated testing and formatting
- Proper error handling

## üìù How to Work on This Project

### The Branch-by-Branch Approach

This project is organized into numbered branches, each representing a step in building your MLOps system. Think of it like a guided tutorial where each branch teaches you something new!

**Here's how it works**:

1. **Each branch = One pull request** with specific tasks
2. **Follow the numbers** (branch_0, branch_1, etc.) in order
3. **Read the PR instructions** (PR_0.md, PR_1.md, etc.) before starting
4. **Complete all TODOs** in that branch's code
5. **Create a pull request** when done
6. **Merge and move to the next branch**

### Step-by-Step Workflow

For each numbered branch:

```bash
# Switch to the branch
git checkout branch_number_i

# Get latest changes (except for branch_1)
git pull origin main
# Note: A VIM window might open - just type ":wq" to close it

# Push your branch
git push
```

Then:
1. üìñ Read the PR_i.md file carefully
2. üíª Complete all the TODOs in the code
3. üîß Test your changes
4. üì§ Open **ONE** pull request to your main branch
5. ‚úÖ Merge the pull request
6. üîÑ Move to the next branch

> **üí° Pro Tip**: Always integrate your previous work when starting a new branch (except branch_1)!

### üîç Understanding Pull Requests

Pull Requests (PRs) are how you propose and review changes before merging them into your main codebase. They're essential for team collaboration!

**Important**: When creating a PR, make sure you're merging into YOUR forked repository, not the original:

‚ùå **Wrong** (merging to original repo):
![PR Wrong](assets/PR_wrong.png)

‚úÖ **Correct** (merging to your fork):
![PR Right](assets/PR_right.png)
